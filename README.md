# Number-Barckhoba
This is a Python-based game, that finds out what number did the player think between 1 and 100.  The program uses a list that contains all the whole integers between 1 and 102. It asks the player questions and modifies the list based on the answers. When the list is short enough the program starts to guess numbers directly. If the guess is right the game has won, otherwise the program guesses another number from the list.
